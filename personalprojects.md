The projects here will be organized (mostly) by date.

### The Hackintoshing of the XPS 15
On October 6, 2020, Gabe purchased a Dell XPS 15 9500 for school and gaming purposes.  
It originally came with Windows 10, but I wanted to install macOS on it so that I could use macOS for work and Windows for Games.  
I started the hackintosh project in early June 2021. I used my Grade 12 computer engineering course as a test subject for running apps and taking notes in macOS.  
As it stands right now, the XPS runs macOS 95% of the time, and works without any flaws (barring the fact that sleep mode doesn't work).  


### The Minecraft Server  
So, in 2019, I took over hosting the Minecraft Server from Simren and since then I've been maintaining it and running it 24/7. Full details can be found [here](/MinecraftServer/origin-story).  

There's a whole page for the Minecraft Server with a Wiki and a changelog which you can find [here:](/MinecraftServer)
